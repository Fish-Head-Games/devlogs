## Overview

This week I add new functionality to support the following features:
- **New Fish Models**: The models have been updated to use Ashley's (PixelTiger's) latest goldfish and angelfish models. This gives a lot more life to the game!
- **Tutorials**: I've added some tutorials to help guide new players in test out the game and learning about all of the features. These are very simple and placeholder right now, but provide the foundation for expanding out more tutorials in the future.
- **Steam Deck Build**: Lastly I created a build of the game of the Steam Deck and demonstrate it! It is always super satisfying to see a build going on the Deck because it makes it feel so much closer to the final product and user experience!

Check out the video below for an overview and demonstration of these features!

## Plan for Next Week
- [ ] Add more functionality to the walking scene (procedural generation and tutorials)
- [ ] Fix the gameplay system for earning coins and spending them on fish food and the gachapon machine
- [ ] Other minor tweaks (e.g., selling fish, turning fish into fish food, performing fish edits from inventory view)
