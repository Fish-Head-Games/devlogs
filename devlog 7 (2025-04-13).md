## Overview

Hi! Oz here with a couple of updates for our game **Lonnies Fishtank**!

The past few weeks we worked on:
- **Animations and Dynamic Bones**: Ashley put in a ton of work rigging up and skinning the fish models to get things in a place for us to use animations in the game. Now the fish are fully featured with 5 animations. The dynamic bones further add visual interest to these animations by making the fish feel more alive and animated as their swimming around the tank.
- **UI Elements**: Adrian worked on quite a few new UI elements to start improving the visual aesthetics of the game. The work-in-progress fish selection inventory adds a lot of character to opening up the menu, and new title screen logo for the game gives it a solid visual identity and sets the expectation for what kind of game Lonnies Fishtank really is!
- **Walking Scene Updates**: Adrian also created some new elements that are featured in the refined 2D walk scene. The scene and features are still a work-in-progress, but we are on the right track to fleshing things out more and have established a strong momentum. 
- **Windsock Fish Textures**: Adrian and Ashley did some additional work getting preliminary textures going for the fish so that they look more interesting! They worked on a sample texture inspired by fish windsocks (Japanese Koinobori).

Check out all of these updates in the devlog video below!
