This week I added the foundational code for more of the basic features for the Lonnies Fishtank vertical slice. Key features added include:
- The ability to rename and remove fish
- A basic gachapon scene where players and click a button to get a new fish added to their tank
- A simple walking the fish scene where the fish flops infinitely forward along a partially procedurally generated path.
