## Overview

This week I worked on the following features:
- **Fish Petting**: Players can now pet their fish and the fish will emit different reactions to being pet.
- **Fish Hunger**: Fish can now become hungry and will eat the food closest to them in the tank.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: The time of day can now be changed. The intent is to advance the time of day as players perform certain actions.
- **Gameplay Planning**: Several ideas were brainstormed to add functionality to the game. These include managing fish stress and health via their diet, the tank conditions, and improving your ability as a fish caretaker by training them.
- **Fish Animations**: After weeks of hard work, Ashley was able to setup the rigs on the goldfish and angelfish. They are now able to be animated!

Check out the demonstration video below for an overview of these additions!
