## Overview

- **Fish Petting**: Players can now pet their fish and the fish will emit different reactions to being pet.
- **Gameplay Planning**: Several ideas were brainstormed to add functionality to the game. These include managing fish stress and health via their diet, the tank conditions, and improving your ability as a fish caretaker by training them and preparing them for the fish competition.
- **Fish Animations**: After a week of hard work, Ashley was able to setup the rig on the goldfish. They are now able to be animated!
