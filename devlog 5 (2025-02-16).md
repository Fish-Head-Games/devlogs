## Overview

This week I worked on the following features:
- **Added environment assets**: now all of the scenes look like they take place in a real environment and not just an empty vacuum!
- **Updated the walking scene**: the walking scene now has a better flow between the planning state and the actual walking state. It is also possible to encounter your neighbors during your walk in various events! 
- **Tank decorating**: Now players can add some pizazz to their tank by placing various decor around in it.
- **Achievements**: now players will be able to see what they accomplished during their game and have more of a directive on what to do in the game.
- **Major code refactors**: I spent some time cleaning up a bunch of the code so that it is easier to add new types of scenes with diverse functionality. This was critical to improve code reuse and to keep the project organized.
- **Bug fixes**: fish renaming, deletion and other bugs from the previous build have been fixed.

Check out the demonstration video below for an overview of these features!

## Plan for Next Week

- [ ] Basic fish interactions between each other
- [ ] Interactions between player and the fish: fetch, tug of war, petting
- [ ] More tank decor
- [ ] Fish accessories
- [ ] Receiving things from wall events: fish, money, tank decor, fish accessories
- [ ] The public pond for viewing other people's fish (ie, Miiverse-like idea)
